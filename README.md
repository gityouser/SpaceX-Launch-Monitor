## SpaceX Launches Timeline


This project showcases the render optimizations provided by [React Virtualized](http://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/List) package.


It is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and it uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to manage routing.<br>

## Steps to run

Clone the repository and run:
### `npm install`
### `npm run build` (yarn build)
### `npm run start` (yarn start)

The server will probably default to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080), if the port is not already taken.

To run the app in development mode, run:
### `npm run dev`
